            "vehicles and modern equipment. This loss inevitably took some weeks to\n" +
            "repair, and in the first two of those weeks the battle in France has\n" +
            "been lost. When we consider the heroic resistance made by the French\n" +
            "Army against heavy odds in this battle, the enormous losses inflicted\n" +
            "upon the enemy and the evident exhaustion of the enemy, it may well be\n" +
            "the thought that these 25 divisions of the best-trained and\n" +
            "best-equipped troops might have turned the scale. However, General\n" +
            "Weygand had to fight without them. Only three British divisions or\n" +
            "their equivalent were able to stand in the line with their French\n" +
            "comrades. They have suffered severely, but they have fought well. We\n" +

            "they have time, will select their documents to tell their stories. We\n" +

            "years which led up to this catastrophe. They seek to indict those who\n" +
            "were responsible for the guidance of our affairs. This also would be a\n" +
            "foolish and pernicious process. There are too many in it. Let each man\n" +

            "men--are safely back in this country. Others are still fighting with\n" +
            "the French, and fighting with considerable success in their local\n" +

            "\n" +
            "We have, therefore, in this Island today a very large and powerful\n" +

            "France? I must make it clear that, apart from the divisions training\n" +
            "and organizing at home, only twelve divisions were equipped to fight\n" +
            "upon a scale which justified their being sent abroad. And this was\n" +

            "be available in France at the ninth month of the war. The rest of our\n" +
            "forces at home have a fighting value for home defense which will, of\n" +
            "course, steadily increase every week that passes. Thus, the invasion\n" +
            "of Great Britain would at this time require the transportation across\n" +
            "the sea of hostile armies on a very large scale, and after they had\n" +

            "people seem to forget that we have a Navy. We must remind them. For\n" +
            "the last thirty years I have been concerned in discussions about the\n" +
            "possibilities of oversea invasion, and I took the responsibility on\n" +
            "behalf of the Admiralty, at the beginning of the last war, of allowing\n" +
            "all regular troops to be sent out of the country. That was a very\n" +
            "serious step to take, because our Territorials had only just been\n" +
            "called up and were quite untrained. Therefore, this Island was for\n" +
            "several months particularly denuded of fighting troops. The Admiralty\n" +
            "had confidence at that time in their ability to prevent a mass\n" +
            "invasion even though at that time the Germans had a magnificent battle\n" +
            "fleet in the proportion of 10 to 16, even though they were capable of\n" +
            "fighting a general engagement every day and any day, whereas now they\n" +
            "have only a couple of heavy ships worth speaking of--the Scharnhorst\n" +
            "and the Gneisenau. We are also told that the Italian Navy is to come\n" +
            "out and gain sea superiority in these waters. If they seriously intend\n" +
            "it, I shall only say that we shall be delighted to offer Signor\n" +
            "Mussolini a free and safeguarded passage through the Strait of\n" +
            "Gibraltar in order that he may play the part to which he\n" +
            "aspires. There is a general curiosity in the British Fleet to find out\n" +
            "whether the Italians are up to the level they were at in the last war\n" +
            "or whether they have fallen off at all.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Therefore, it seems to me that as far as sea-borne invasion on a great\n" +
            "scale is concerned, we are far more capable of meeting it today than\n" +
            "we were at many periods in the last war and during the early months of\n" +
            "this war, before our other troops were trained, and while the\n" +
            "B.E.F. had proceeded abroad. Now, the Navy have never pretended to be\n" +
            "able to prevent raids by bodies of 5,000 or 10,000 men flung suddenly\n" +
            "across and thrown ashore at several points on the coast some dark\n" +
            "night or foggy morning. The efficacy of sea power, especially under\n" +
            "modern conditions, depends upon the invading force being of large\n" +
            "size; It has to be of large size, in view of our military strength, to\n" +
            "be of any use. If it is of large size, then the Navy have something\n" +
            "they can find and meet and, as it were, bite on. Now, we must remember\n" +
            "that even five divisions, however lightly equipped, would require 200\n" +
            "to 250 ships, and with modern air reconnaissance and photography it\n" +
            "would not be easy to collect such an armada, marshal it, and conduct\n" +
            "it across the sea without any powerful naval forces to escort it; and\n" +
            "there would be very great possibilities, to put it mildly, that this\n" +
            "armada would be intercepted long before it reached the coast, and all\n" +
            "the men drowned in the sea or, at the worst blown to pieces with their\n" +
            "equipment while they were trying to land. We also have a great system\n" +
            "of minefields, recently strongly reinforced, through which we alone\n" +
            "know the channels. If the enemy tries to sweep passages through these\n" +
            "minefields, it will be the task of the Navy to destroy the\n" +
            "mine-sweepers and any other forces employed to protect them. There\n" +
            "should be no difficulty in this, owing to our great superiority at\n" +
            "sea.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Those are the regular, well-tested, well-proved arguments on which we\n" +
            "have relied during many years in peace and war. But the question is\n" +
            "whether there are any new methods by which those solid assurances can\n" +
            "be circumvented. Odd as it may seem, some attention has been given to\n" +
            "this by the Admiralty, whose prime duty and responsibility is to\n" +
            "destroy any large sea-borne expedition before it reaches, or at the\n" +
            "moment when it reaches, these shores. It would not be a good thing for\n" +
            "me to go into details of this. It might suggest ideas to other people\n" +
            "which they have not thought of, and they would not be likely to give\n" +
            "us any of their ideas in exchange. All I will say is that untiring\n" +
            "vigilance and mind-searching must be devoted to the subject, because\n" +
            "the enemy is crafty and cunning and full of novel treacheries and\n" +
            "stratagems. The House may be assured that the utmost ingenuity is\n" +
            "being displayed and imagination is being evoked from large numbers of\n" +
            "competent officers, well-trained in tactics and thoroughly up to date,\n" +
            "to measure and counterwork novel possibilities. Untiring vigilance and\n" +
            "untiring searching of the mind is being, and must be, devoted to the\n" +
            "subject, because, remember, the enemy is crafty and there is no dirty\n" +
            "trick he will not do.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Some people will ask why, then, was it that the British Navy was not\n" +
            "able to prevent the movement of a large army from Germany into Norway\n" +
            "across the Skagerrak? But the conditions in the Channel and in the\n" +
            "North Sea are in no way like those which prevail in the Skagerrak. In\n" +
            "the Skagerrak, because of the distance, we could give no air support\n" +
            "to our surface ships, and consequently, lying as we did close to the\n" +
            "enemy's main air power, we were compelled to use only our\n" +
            "submarines. We could not enforce the decisive blockade or interruption\n" +
            "which is possible from surface vessels. Our submarines took a heavy\n" +
            "toll but could not, by themselves, prevent the invasion of Norway. In\n" +
            "the Channel and in the North Sea, on the other hand, our superior\n" +
            "naval surface forces, aided by our submarines, will operate with close\n" +
            "and effective air assistance.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "This brings me, naturally, to the great question of invasion from the\n" +
            "air, and of the impending struggle between the British and German Air\n" +
            "Forces. It seems quite clear that no invasion on a scale beyond the\n" +
            "capacity of our land forces to crush speedily is likely to take place\n" +
            "from the air until our Air Force has been definitely overpowered. In\n" +
            "the meantime, there may be raids by parachute troops and attempted\n" +
            "descents of airborne soldiers. We should be able to give those gentry\n" +
            "a warm reception both in the air and on the ground, if they reach it\n" +
            "in any condition to continue the dispute. But the great question is:\n" +
            "Can we break Hitler's air weapon? Now, of course, it is a very great\n" +
            "pity that we have not got an Air Force at least equal to that of the\n" +
            "most powerful enemy within striking distance of these shores. But we\n" +
            "have a very powerful Air Force which has proved itself far superior in\n" +
            "quality, both in men and in many types of machine, to what we have met\n" +
            "so far in the numerous and fierce air battles which have been fought\n" +
            "with the Germans. In France, where we were at a considerable\n" +
            "disadvantage and lost many machines on the ground when they were\n" +
            "standing round the aerodromes, we were accustomed to inflict in the\n" +
            "air losses of as much as two and two-and-a-half to one. In the\n" +
            "fighting over Dunkirk, which was a sort of no-man's-land, we\n" +
            "undoubtedly beat the German Air Force, and gained the mastery of the\n" +
            "local air, inflicting here a loss of three or four to one day after\n" +
            "day. Anyone who looks at the photographs which were published a week\n" +
            "or so ago of the re-embarkation, showing the masses of troops\n" +
            "assembled on the beach and forming an ideal target for hours at a\n" +
            "time, must realize that this re-embarkation would not have been\n" +
            "possible unless the enemy had resigned all hope of recovering air\n" +
            "superiority at that time and at that place.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In the defense of this Island the advantages to the defenders will be\n" +
            "much greater than they were in the fighting around Dunkirk. We hope to\n" +
            "improve on the rate of three or four to one which was realized at\n" +
            "Dunkirk; and in addition all our injured machines and their crews\n" +
            "which get down safely--and, surprisingly, a very great many injured\n" +
            "machines and men do get down safely in modern air fighting--all of\n" +
            "these will fall, in an attack upon these Islands, on friendly soil and\n" +
            "live to fight another day; whereas all the injured enemy machines and\n" +
            "their complements will be total losses as far as the war is concerned.\n" +

            "During the great battle in France, we gave very powerful and\n" +

            "in spite of every kind of pressure we never would allow the entire\n" +
            "metropolitan fighter strength of the Air Force to be consumed. This\n" +
            "decision was painful, but it was also right, because the fortunes of\n" +
            "the battle in France could not have been decisively affected even if\n" +
            "we had thrown in our entire fighter force. That battle was lost by the\n" +

            "power of the armored columns, and by the great preponderance of the\n" +

            "exhausted as a mere accident in that great struggle, and then we\n" +
